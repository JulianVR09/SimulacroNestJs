# Project Overview

This project is built with **MongoDB** and includes various features such as:

- **Validations**: Ensuring data integrity and format correctness.
- **Guards**: For implementing authentication and authorization.
- **Filters**: Handling errors and transforming responses.
- **Interceptors**: Modifying request/response before they are handled.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

### 3. Start the project in development mode

After the dependencies are installed, start the project in development mode using the following command:

\`\`\`bash
npm run start:dev
\`\`\`

This will launch the project, and you can begin working with it.

## Features

- **MongoDB** as the primary database.
- **Guards** and **Interceptors** to enhance the request/response lifecycle.
- **Validations** to ensure proper data flow.
- **Filters** for error handling and data transformation.

Make sure you have **MongoDB** running locally or connected remotely before starting the project.
